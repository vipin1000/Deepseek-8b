DeepSeek is an AI-powered text search and query tool built to allow easy extraction and similarity search from PDFs. It leverages advanced embeddings to provide contextually relevant results based on your query. The project consists of two main components:

Components:
1. app.py 🖥️
Purpose: app.py serves as the main interface to run DeepSeek using Ollama and subprocess. It connects to the core functionalities and handles the processing of documents and queries.
2. cht.py 🤖
Purpose: cht.py runs the Chainer model using Ollama and subprocess. This component integrates with Streamlit to allow a web-based interface for users to interact with the AI model.

Prerequisites:
Python 3.x
Ollama
ChromaDB
Streamlit (for interactive interface)
